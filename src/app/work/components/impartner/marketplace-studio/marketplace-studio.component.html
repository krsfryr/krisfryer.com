                        <p>With Impartner's strong preference for high-fidelity output and an existing design system in place, I jumped straight into Figma. Past client implementations had already revealed what worked and what didn't, so I used those real-world learnings as my foundation. From the start, we prioritized flexibility, reusability, and brandability; key pillars for a scalable SaaS feature that would need to serve dozens of unique clients.</p>
                        <p>Instead of asking users to configure confusing object relationships, we built a solution that worked behind the scenes. Two dedicated applications, one for Partner Marketplaces and one for Solutions, which gave clarity to users while preserving backend logic.</p>

                    <p>I designed custom filters, search layouts, listing cards, and configuration tools inside Marketplace Studio, all while ensuring visual and functional consistency across the broader platform.</p>
                    <p>We designed a lightweight theming system that gave clients control without compromising accessibility or brand cohesion. The branding tab allowed customers to select primary colors that seamlessly styled CTAs and links without opening the door to design chaos.</p>

                    <p>I ran user tests using interactive prototypes and collaborated directly with Early Access (EA) clients as they explored in-progress builds. These feedback loops revealed edge cases, surfaced feature requests, and shaped the UI into something clients actually wanted to use. These weren't abstract UX decisions, they were sharpened by client reality.</p>
                    <p>Internally, I collaborated with the team in bi-weekly review sessions to tackle blockers and continuously improve the experience.</p>

                    <p>Design handoff wasn't just a phase, it was baked into the process.</p>
                    <p>After finalizing a feature in Figma, I marked it as “dev ready,” triggering assignment by the PM for the upcoming sprint. Developers always had clarity on what was coming next, minimizing churn and speeding up implementation.</p>
                    <p>Collaborating with Product, Engineering, and Onboarding from the beginning meant that everyone had shared context and we could move fast without breaking things.</p>
