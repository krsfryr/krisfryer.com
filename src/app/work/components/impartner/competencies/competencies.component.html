        <div class="listing-details">
            <div class="listing-intro">
                <p>In today's partner ecosystems, showcasing the strengths and expertise of partners is crucial for driving business success. However, many Partner Relationship Management (PRM) platforms lack the necessary tools to effectively represent partner achievements at the account level. As a UX/UI designer at Impartner, I was tasked with designing a Competency Management solution that would allow administrators to define and display account-level competencies, such as certifications, specialties, and awards, while seamlessly integrating these features into the broader PRM ecosystem.</p>
                <p>This project not only aimed to address the gaps in existing tools but also to provide clients with a streamlined, flexible way to manage and present partner competencies, enabling better segmentation, improved partner discoverability, and more robust reporting. The result is a user-friendly interface that empowers PRM admins to enhance their partners' visibility and success within the marketplace.</p>

                        <p>One key requirement was ensuring users could easily identify and update the published state of the competency. Initially, we explored various design patterns, including toggles and dropdowns, to manage this status. However, since autosave is not a feature in the PRM application, using a toggle didn't align well with the existing pattern.</p>
                        <p>After considering placement options, we decided that placing the status control in the header would provide the best user experience. However, a dropdown in the header disrupted the flow. Ultimately, we landed on a segmented control, which proved to be the ideal solution. It not only clearly displays the current status (Published or Unpublished) but also allows users to switch between states and easily save their changes.</p>

Most fields were required, except for the public description, which we made clear to the user.</p>
                        <p>We decided on a two-column layout: all the text fields are on the left, while the image upload sits on the right. This approach not only follows best design practices but also helps users focus on filling out the content and uploading an image separately.

                        <p>This section showcases the badges and achievements you've earned. To make the information visually appealing and easy to understand, we designed a layout that prioritizes clarity and organization.</p>
                        <p>The badge name, the most important detail, is displayed in a larger font size to immediately grab attention. Each badge also has a category, which is positioned above the name to provide context. The earned or assigned date is placed below the title for easy reference.</p>
                        <p>To ensure a clean and consistent presentation, we aligned the badge images to the right and the accompanying text to the left. This layout makes it simple to scan the information and quickly identify the badges and their details.</p>

                        <p>The available section lists all the badges that partners can earn. To visually distinguish it from the current section, we used a colored background and placed the badge images within a container to prevent any color conflicts.</p>
                            
                        <p>To make it easy for partners to claim completed badges, we added an 'Add claim' button. Clicking this button opens a modal where the user must provide a description of their accomplishments and upload any supporting documentation. Once submitted, the badge will display a 'Pending approval' status. Once submitted, the user can also edit their claim if needed.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Balancing Functionality and Simplicity</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges in this project was ensuring the interface had all the necessary features without overwhelming the user. For instance, instead of using more complex options like dropdowns or toggles, we opted for a segmented control in the header to manage the competency status. This made it much easier for users to find and update key information while keeping the interface clean and intuitive.</p>

                <h3 class="h4">Flexibility for User Needs</h3>
                <p>Another key takeaway was making sure the system was flexible enough to meet different user needs. We understood that users might need varying levels of control, so we added options like leaving expiration dates blank for competencies that never expire, and bulk editing tools to save time when managing multiple accounts. This flexibility was crucial in making the system both efficient and user-friendly.</p>
